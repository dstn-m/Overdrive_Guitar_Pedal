# Overdrive_Guitar_Pedal
This project involved replicating the major components of a popular guitar effect pedal, the Boss SD-1. It was, in part, a fun opportunity to get some more experience using Altium, which previously I had only used for two class projects.

Please see the included PDF, "Building_An_Overdrive_Guitar_Pedal" for a detailed discussion of the project, including calculations and simulations of the tone control portions of the circuit.
